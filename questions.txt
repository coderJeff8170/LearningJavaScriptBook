when you put variables inside an object, does that mean they are not available outside
that object, except when called?
-as in user {name, age}

ask about //     return new Date().getFullYear() - age;

ask about //     return new Date().getFullYear() - user.age;
            //     return new Date().getFullYear() - this.age;

let globalFunc; //undefined global function
{
    let blockVar = 'a'; //block scoped variable
    globalFunc = function() {
        console.log(blockVar);
    }
}
globalFunc();   HOW COME globalfunc is available outside the block, even when you remove it's declaration?

ask about the closure with "not so safe after all"
//not sure of the implications of this, but i suspect that things within the closure can
//be changed? OOOOOOOHHHHHHH! Yah. You can change F from outside the closure by assigning
// it to a variable. This is why IIFEs are so important?
